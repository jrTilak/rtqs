# Overview

**RTQS (Real-Time Quiz System)** is an open-source, plugin-based system for building real-time and standard quiz applications on the web.

It provides a core runtime for quiz sessions, real-time synchronization, and event handling, while most behavior is extended through plugins. This keeps the core small and allows developers to add or modify features without changing internal code.

RTQS is fully open source, allowing self-hosting, forking, and deep customization based on project needs.

# Contribution

You can contribute to RTQS in two ways:

- **Core platform**: improve the server, web client, or documentation
- **Plugins**: create plugins to extend quiz logic, features, or integrations
